Intended Use
------------
OTABase is a research framework for evaluating the robustness of LTE baseband implementations against memory corruption vulnerabilities.  
It is intended to be used in controlled research environments (e.g., academic testbeds, shielded RF labs) for security analysis and reproducibility of our paperâ€™s findings.  
The framework can generate, transmit, and evaluate RRC/NAS protocol test cases to identify memory safety issues.

Limitations
-----------
- OTABase is NOT intended for use in operational cellular networks.  
- Experiments require specialized RF hardware and a shielded test environment; running tests on live commercial networks is prohibited.  
- The framework is provided for research and educational purposes only; it must not be used for malicious exploitation.  
- Due to hardware requirements, the artifact package only supports offline demonstrations (message generation, mutation, oracle simulation) unless the user has access to a proper RF testbed.
- Since OTABase treats commercial basebands as black-box systems, final confirmation and root-cause analysis require vendor-side investigation with access to internal crash dumps or source code.
