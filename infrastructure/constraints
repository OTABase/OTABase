OTABase Artifact â€“ Infrastructure Constraints
=============================================

Required Infrastructure
-----------------------
- Ubuntu 18.04 or 22.04 LTS server
- Software-Defined Radio (USRP B210) with antenna
- Programmable SIM card and smart card reader
- Commercial test smartphones (reproducing our findings requires older firmware versions with known 1-day vulnerabilities, as the issues have been patched)
- Faraday cage or equivalent RF shielding environment

Constraints
-----------
The OTABase framework relies on over-the-air communication between a software-defined base station and commercial smartphones.  
This setup requires:
- Transmission and reception of LTE NAS/RRC messages over real radio channels.
- Shielded environments (e.g., Faraday cage) to ensure no interference with public cellular networks.

Due to these requirements, OTABase cannot be executed on public cloud-based research infrastructures (e.g., CloudLab, Chameleon, FABRIC, SPHERE, Google Colab), which do not provide SDR peripherals, programmable SIMs, or controlled RF environments.

Rationale
---------
The use of physical RF components and real smartphones is essential to run OTABase against commercial LTE basebands.  
Without these hardware dependencies and shielding requirements, end-to-end experiments are not feasible.  
Therefore, the artifact package provides the full implementation, a detailed README containing step-by-step setup guides, which can be used to deploy OTABase in a dedicated RF testbed when the required hardware is available.
